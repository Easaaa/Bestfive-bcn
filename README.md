A PWA application for tourism in Barcelona, that help you discover local places to visit or hidden gems to feed you.

I built this application with HTML, SCSS and JavaScript. 
I learned how to use Google Maps API and ho to retrive informations with it, like weekly hours.

Currentyly weekly hours are hard coded due to the fee that Google covers for it.
Currently service worker is not active to improve the usability with the ongoing update. 

The App is built in collaboration with my girlfriend, Francisca.

To have a better user experience I suggest to use it from mobile.
